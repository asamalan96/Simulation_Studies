Hi all:

Following up on our discussion earlier, I am herewith attaching some materials concerning my first attempt at the comparison of cosmic muon flux, from last year.

I will provide a short description on the content of these documents below.

- In the attachment, you'll find an excel file with two sheets, each containing different fits to the Bonechi et al data. In the first sheet, the differential flux data is compared with a parameterization function contained in Bonechi's thesis (see tesi_bonechi.pdf; it's in Italian but the relevant information can be found in Section 6.4 onwards). The second one uses Reyna's scaling law, which is described in more detail in reyna_scaling.pdf. The two parameterization differ more noticeably in the low momenta region as well as for almost horizontal muons (zenith angle > 80) due to lack of experimental data.

- I've also the attached the results from the comparison between CRY and Bonechi parameterization (in both .png and .root formats). It should be noted that I was using arbitrary normalization for producing these comparison plots at various angles. However, now that we have more expertise and a clear understanding on how CRY normalization works, perhaps it would be interesting to see the same with proper normalization. Additionally, the Padova group were also puzzled by the usual multiple peaks-like features (for p < ~3 GeV/c region) in the CRY distributions -- I'm yet to delve into it in more detail but I can confirm that it is more than just a simple histogram-binning problem.

Please, let me know if anything is unclear.

Cheers,
Samip


Indeed. We are using the fit function as well as constants from Section 6.4.1 (Flusso in direzione verticale) in your thesis. And you are also correct about the extrapolation for th=85 deg plot -- the extrapolation is carried with the help of fit function for calculating the momentum dependent vertical flux. All the steps can easily be traced back in the excel file I shared yesterday. In case, you missed my email yesterday, you can also access it from our agenda under "Generators": https://agenda.infn.it/event/24954/
